This is a plugin for Sublime Text 3. It allows for quick creation of common CodeIgniter files. Just
bring up the context menu and click "New CI_Model" Then type in your model name, press enter, and a new 
file is created and filled with the skeleton for the model. Same goes for Migrations and Controllers.

Feel free to take this code and do whatever you want with it. It is fairly simple and straight forward. 

I used this project to teach myself a bit about how Sublime Plugins work. As well as creating a nifty
little tool for me to use. Hopefully someone else can get some use out of it as well.
